This repository will contain any major project I did during my studies at University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering. Over time, more projects may be added.

A few words regarding each project listed:

1. <b>MEAN stack project</b><br/>
    This project was a part of Programming of Internet Applications course. Unfortunately I do not have the specification used during development. It mainly revolves around simple workings of shops/restaurants.

2. <b>MicroJava Compiler</b><br/>
    A simple Compiler for MicroJava programming language developed in Java. It covers all phases of compiling. A PDF (and a Word document) are given explaining how the Compiler works, however right now it is only available in my native language (Serbian). I will add the specification of MicroJava language used during development if I can find it.

3. <b>Kernel project</b><br/>
    Probably the most important project listed here. It is a simple multithreaded kernel with time-sharing support for x86 processor written in Borland C/C++ '92 standard. The file userMain.cpp is missing because we were given tests during lab. If I get my hands on one I will provide it. Specification of the project is missing due to the fact that the project changed and is more modernized as of now.

IMPORTANT NOTICES:
* MEAN stack project and MicroJava Compiler can be run on a modern day machine.
* Kernel project can only be run in a DOS emulator. I tested it in Command Line of Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit.
* Code is provided as is; I tested everything on my machine. For MicroJava Compiler NETBeans IDE is recommended, for Kernel Eclipse IDE is recommended.
* These projects are mainly posted here for others who might be interested in them, and maybe for my colleagues who might have trouble implementing certain parts of their projects.
